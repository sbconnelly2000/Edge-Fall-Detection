TinyFall: Real-Time Fall Detection on Edge HardwareTinyFall is an ultra-lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to detect falls in real-time on embedded microcontrollers. Optimized for the [INSERT HARDWARE NAME, e.g., Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense], this model achieves 96.9% accuracy while consuming only 50kB of memory and running inference in 0.04ms.🚀 Key FeaturesTiny Footprint: Aggressively quantized TFLite model (Int8/Float16) fitting within 50kB.Privacy-First: All processing happens on-device; no data is sent to the cloud.Robust Inference: Implements a sliding window algorithm to detect falls continuously without waiting for discrete data buffers.🛠️ Technical Implementation1. Data Pipeline & ArchitectureInput: 3-axis Accelerometer/Gyroscope data sampled at [INSERT Hz].Model: 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.Optimization: Increased kernel size to [X] to capture longer temporal dependencies.2. Embedded EngineeringQuantization: Post-training quantization reduced model size by [X]% with only a 0.1% drop in accuracy (97.0% $\to$ 96.9%).Latency: Optimized sliding window implementation reduced inference latency to 0.04ms, enabling real-time response.📊 Performance MetricsMetricValueAccuracy (Quantized)96.9%Model Size50 kBInference Time0.04 msHardware[Insert Hardware Name]💻 How to RunPrerequisitesPython 3.8+TensorFlow / TFLite Runtime[Hardware Name] connected via Serial/BluetoothInstallationBashgit clone https://github.com/sbconnelly2000/TinyFall-Edge-Detection.git

Step 3: The "Visual" ProofYou currently have a PDF presentation (annotated-Final_Presentation.pptx.pdf). This is buried treasure.Extract Images: Open that PDF and take a screenshot of:The Model Architecture diagram (showing the layers).Any graphs showing the accuracy/loss.A photo of the actual hardware/sensor.Add them to the README: Place these images in the "Technical Implementation" section I drafted above.Step 4: The Code CleanupRecruiters will click on your Python script. Currently, CheckPoint_predict_slide.py likely has hardcoded paths or imports that only work on your machine.Add Comments: Add a docstring at the top of the file explaining what it does.Python"""
